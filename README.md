# rf2-VRDOF
This is a "playground" of sorts to experiment with cheap techniques to reduce pixelazition in cheap VR headsets (like the PSVR).

You probably dont want to use this code, if you want better VR get a better HMD/GPU.

Also this demonstrates how to hook OpenVR VRCompositor()->Submit(), which applies to any games using OpenVR, in case you want to make your own overlays etc.
